# Common Rust Attributes

Rust provides several attributes that can control compiler checks and modify the behavior of the linting system. These attributes help manage warnings or change how the compiler handles certain aspects of your code. Here's an overview of some commonly used attributes:

- **`#[allow(dead_code)]`**: Suppresses warnings for unused functions, variables, struct fields, etc. Useful during development when experimenting with code that might not be called initially.
- **`#[warn(...)]`**: Elevates a lint's level to a warning for the annotated code. Replace `...` with the name of the lint. Useful for ensuring that certain best practices are not ignored.

- **`#[deny(...)]`**: Similar to `#[warn(...)]`, but treats the specified lints as errors rather than warnings. This is stronger than `warn` and enforces strict code quality standards.

- **`#[forbid(...)]`**: Even stricter than `#[deny(...)]`. Once set, it cannot be overridden by inner attributes. Stops compilation with an error if any violations are found.

- **`#[allow(unused_variables)]`**: Suppresses warnings for variables that are declared but never used. Useful for placeholders in developing functions.

- **`#[allow(unused_imports)]`**: Suppresses warnings for import statements that are not used in the code. Handy during development when trying different libraries or modules.

- **`#[allow(unused_mut)]`**: Suppresses warnings for variables declared as mutable (`mut`) but never mutated. Helps when planning to modify the variables later during development.

- **`#[allow(non_snake_case)]`**: Prevents warnings for using naming conventions that do not adhere to the snake_case style, which is recommended for function and variable names in Rust.

- **`#[allow(non_camel_case_types)]`**: Suppresses warnings for type names that are not in CamelCase, the convention for naming types in Rust.

- **`#[allow(non_upper_case_globals)]`**: Suppresses warnings for global variables that do not use UPPER_CASE, the conventional style for constants and global variables in Rust.

- **`#[allow(clippy::...)]`**: Specifically used to allow or suppress warnings generated by Clippy, a Rust linter aimed at catching common mistakes and improving your Rust code. Replace `...` with the specific Clippy lint you want to control.

These attributes are part of Rust's attribute system, providing control over the compiler's behavior regarding your code. They are especially useful for managing large codebases and ensuring adherence to specific coding guidelines and standards.
